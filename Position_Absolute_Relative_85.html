<p>On the morning of Sept. 22, employees at Great Big Story received some good news. The digital 
video publisher’s biggest advertiser, Hyundai-owned Genesis, had signed a new sponsorship deal worth more than $1 million, they were told during their regular 9:30 a.m. 
morning meeting.
The announcement was especially encouraging because many 
employees had believed the automative brand would not be renewing
its deal and the lost revenue would put Great Big Story in an even more precarious financial situation than they
 feared the CNN-owned 
company may already be in.At 6:45 p.m. that evening, Great Big Story employees received an email from CNN vp of 
digital productions Courtney Coupe, a founding member of Great Big Story who oversaw the media company. The email notified the employees that an all-hands meeting would be scheduled for the following morning at 9:30 a.m
