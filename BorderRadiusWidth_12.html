<p class="text">I'm going under and this time I fear there's no one to save me
This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy.
I need somebody to healSomebody to know!
Somebody to have,Somebody to hold.It's easy to say,
But it's never the same.
I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain.
Now the day bleeds.
Into nightfall.And you're not here,
To get me through it all.I let my guard down.And then you pulled the rug.
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved.
I'm going under and this time I fear there's no one to turn to
This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you.</p>
