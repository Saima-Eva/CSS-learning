<p>On the morning of Sept. 22, employees at Great Big Story received some good news. The digital video publisher’s biggest advertiser, Hyundai-owned Genesis, had signed a new sponsorship deal worth more than $1 million, they were told during their regular 9:30 a.m. 
morning meeting.
The announcement was especially encouraging because many 
employees had believed the automative brand would not be renewing
its deal and the lost revenue would put Great Big Story in an even more precarious financial situation than they feared the CNN-owned 
company may already be in.At 6:45 p.m. that evening, Great Big Story employees received an email from CNN vp of digital productions Courtney Coupe, a founding member of Great Big Story who oversaw the media company. The email notified the employees that an all-hands meeting would be scheduled for the following morning at 9:30 a.m.  

Despite being set for the usual meeting time, the invite featured a few irregularities. For starters, all-hands meetings 
scheduled with short notice are notorious within the media industry as a sign that bad news is imminent and layoffs are likely. But this meeting was also set to be attended by Coupe, who had not attended Great Big Story’s morning meetings for some time, and CNN evp and chief digital officer Andrew Morse, another founding member of Great Big Story, who never attended the morning meeting, according to multiple former employees. And the meeting was scheduled to take place in Coupe’s virtual meeting room, which was not the usual location.

“Immediately everyone was texting everyone, and we all went to bed that night knowing we were going to get let go that next 
day,” said one of 11 former Great Big Story employees that Digiday spoke to for this article.

For many Great Big Story employees, the announcement on Sept. 23 that CNN was shutting down the company was a shock. 
Working at Great Big Story had been a dream job. Editorial employees were able to produce Emmy and Webby Award-winning short-form documentaries about subjects like an Oakland center for disabled artists and an organization working to combat plastic pollution and poverty simultaneously. And employees on the business side were able 
to support content that they enjoyed watching themselves and were proud to show to sponsors and their own family members. It’s unclear how many people worked at Great Big Story at its peak, but a website built to showcase Great Big Story employees who lost their jobs lists 45 employees.

“A way that Great Big Story was explained to me in the early days was this is the place where you get to make that story that you always wanted to make, but your boss said you couldn’t. And that was true,” said a former employee.

For other employees, however, the end of Great Big Story was inevitable.
With the backing of CNN and the resources of WarnerMedia’s sales organization, Great Big Story would appear to have been born with a silver spoon in its mouth and insulated from the financial struggles any fledgling media company would usually face. Instead, its business was burdened by bureaucracy. Great Big Story lost money and lost leaders and — as a startup within a major news organization that’s part of a massive media conglomerate owned by a debt-ridden telecom giant — ultimately lost the support that some employees said was lacking all along and especially at the end of its run.

As one former employee said, “Great Big Story lived how it died: with very little thought or planning. The product was good. The people were talented. There was no planning. There was no leadership. That’s why Great Big Story died.”

“We’re incredibly proud of Great Big Story. Its unique voice, creative producers, award-winning content and passionate audience are proof of its success. Like any startup, it faced organizational obstacles and business challenges over the course of its first few years. But no amount of planning nor prediction could’ve prepared us for the economic impacts of a global pandemic,” said a CNN spokesperson in an emailed statement. The company did not respond to specific details contained in this story shared ahead of publication and did not make Coupe or Morse available for interviews.

The pandemic had certainly taken a toll on Great Big Story. As of September 2020, Great Big Story had only reached 25% 
of its sales goal for the year, according to some former employees. However, its business struggles predated the pandemic. 
In its five-year history, Great Big Story had never turned an annual profit. As one former employee said, “The demise of the 
company started before corona.”CNN launched Great Big Story in October 2015. At the time, digital media darlings like BuzzFeed and Mic were building seemingly successful businesses by producing short-form videos to distribute on platforms like Facebook and YouTube and selling branded content deals to advertisers. Great Big Story was to be CNN’s answer to this new wave of digitally native media companies, but with the advantage of its parent company and a twist in its approach by concentrating on video quality instead of quantity.

“This was taking the resources of CNN and Time Warner [renamed WarnerMedia after it was acquired by AT&T in June 2018] as a whole and applying that to a startup that could then go in the opposite direction. Our pitch [to potential advertisers] was three videos a day while others were doing 2,000 a week,” said a former employee.

However, CNN not only sought to distance Great Big Story from other social video publishers, but also from itself. The company seemed wary of appearing to be the news industry’s embodiment of the “How do you do, fellow kids?” meme.

“An analogy Andrew Morse always used to say was ‘we don’t want to be a grandpa in a speedo.’ I think that’s why they kept it so separate right away, like oil and water,” said a former WarnerMedia employee.

This distancing manifested physically with Great Big Story taking up two floors in an office near New York City’s Union Square while CNN remained uptown at the Time Warner Center. Great Big Story employees largely enjoyed the detachment and developed their own company culture. 
The CNN employees who would trek downtown to Great Big Story’s offices were referred to as “suits” and the Time Warner Center was called “the mothership.”

That distance from CNN and the rest of WarnerMedia, however, “was a double-edged sword,” said a 
former employee. “The downside being we weren’t tapped into the larger presence with the larger company, but at the same 
time we liked the autonomy, feeling like we were the cool creative clubhouse separate from the mothership,”
Over the years, however, the disconnect between Great Big Story and CNN as well as the broader WarnerMedia would fester. “People realized CNN and Great Big Story are two very, very different companies. Nobody knew how CNN and Great Big Story worked together because there was no natural way for that to happen,” 
said a former employee.
Great Big Story survived as long as it did by being bankrolled by CNN, which in 2017 said it had committed to invest $70 million in the company. However, when it came to revenue, at least initially Great Big Story was largely on its own.

Great Big Story had a dedicated sales team within WarnerMedia’s ad sales organization — which was and remains separate from CNN — and could not count on CNN’s dedicated sellers to include Great Big Story in packages alongside CNN’s linear TV or digital ad inventory pitched to big-budget advertisers.

“I was assuming maybe there would be baseline revenue from the sales apparatus that existed [within WarnerMedia’s ad sales organization] as opposed to building from ground zero, 
but that never materialized,” said a former employee.</p>
