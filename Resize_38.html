Albert Einstein was born in Ulm, in the Kingdom of WÃ¼rttemberg in the German Empire, on 14 March 1879.[5] His parents were Hermann Einstein, 
a salesman and engineer, and Pauline Koch. In 1880, the family moved to Munich, where Einstein's father and his uncle Jakob founded Elektrotechnische Fabrik J. Einstein & Cie, 
a company that manufactured electrical equipment based on direct current.[5]

The Einsteins were non-observant Ashkenazi Jews, and Albert attended a Catholic elementary school in Munich, from the age of five,
 for three years. At the age of eight, he was transferred to the Luitpold Gymnasium (now known as the Albert Einstein Gymnasium), where he received advanced primary
 and secondary school education until he left the German Empire seven years later.[18]
