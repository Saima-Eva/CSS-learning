<p>I'm going under and this time I fear there's no one to save me
This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy.
I need somebody to heal
Somebody to know!
Somebody to have,
Somebody to hold.
It's easy to say,
But it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain.
