<p>My mamma," reported Morris Mowgelewsky, choosing a quiet moment during a 
writing period to engage his teacher's attention, "my mamma likes you shall come on mine
 house for see her."
"Very well, dear," answered Miss Bailey with a patience born of many such messages from 
the parents of her small charges. "I think I shall have time to go this afternoon."
"My mamma," Morris began again, "she says I shall tell you 'scuse how she don't send you no
 letter. She couldn't to send no letter the while her eyes ain't healthy." "I am sorry to hear that," 
said Teacher, with a little stab of regret for her prompt acceptance of Mrs. Mowgelewsky's
 invitation; for of all the ailments which the children shared so generously with their teacher,
 Miss Bailey had learned to dread most the many and painful disorders of the eye. She knew,
 however, that Mrs. Mowgelewsky was not one of those who utter unnecessary cries for help,
 being in this regard, as in many others, a striking contrast to 
the majority of parents with whom Miss Bailey came in contact.To begin with, Mrs. Mowgelewsky
 had but one child—her precious, only Morris. In addition to this singularity she was thrifty and neat,
 intensely self-respecting and independent of spirit, and astonishingly outspoken of mind. She neither 
shared nor understood the gregarious spirit which bound her neighbors together and is the lubricant which
 makes East Side crowding possible without bloodshed. No groups of chattering, gesticulating matrons ever 
congregated in her Monroe Street apartment. No love of gossip ever held her on street 
corners or on steps. She nourished few friendships and fewer acquaintanceships, and she welcomed no
 haphazard visitor. Her hospitalities were as serious as her manner; her invitations as deliberate as her slow 
English speech. And Miss Bailey, as she and the First Readers followed the order of studies laid down for them,
 found herself again and again, trying to imagine what the days would be to Mrs. Mowgelewsky if her keen,
 shrewd eyes were to be darkened and useless.
At three o'clock she set out with Morris, leaving the Board of Monitors[78-1] to set Room 18 to rights with no
 more direct supervision than an occasional look and word from the stout Miss Blake, whose kingdom lay 
just across the hall. And as she hurried through the early cold of a November afternoon, her forebodings grew 
so lugubrious that she was almost relieved at last to learn that Mrs. Mowgelewsky's complaint was a
 slow-forming cataract, and her supplication, that Miss Bailey would keep a watchful eye upon Morris while
 his mother was at the hospital undergoing treatment and operation.
"But of course," Miss Bailey agreed, "I shall be delighted to do what I can, Mrs. Mowgelewsky, though it seems
 to me that one of the neighbors——" "Neighbors!" snorted the matron; "What you think the neighbors make
 mit mine little boy? They got four, five dozens childrens theirselves. They ain't got no time for look on Morris. 
They come maybe in mine house und break mine dishes, und rubber on what is here, und set by mine furniture
 und talks. What do they know over takin' care on mine house? They ain't ladies. They is educated only on the
 front. Me, I was raised private und expensive in Russia; I was ladies. Und you ist ladies. You ist Krisht[79-1]—
that is too bad—but that makes me nothings. I wants you shall look on Morris."
"But I can't come here and take care of him," Miss Bailey pointed out. "You see that for yourself, don't you, Mrs. 
Mowgelewsky? I am sorry as I can be about your eyes, and I hope with all my heart that the operation will be
 successful. But I shouldn't
 have time to come here and take care of things." "That ain't how mine mamma means," Morris explained.
 He was leaning against Teacher and stroking her muff as he spoke. "Mine mamma means the money." 
"That ist what I means," said Mrs. Mowgelewsky, nodding her ponderous head until her quite incredible wig 
slipped back and forth upon it. "Morris needs he shall have money. He could to fix the house so good like I can. He don't needs no neighbors rubberin'. He could to buy what he needs on the store. But ten cents a day he needs. His papa works by Harlem. He is got fine jobs, und he gets fine moneys, but he couldn't to come down here for take care of Morris. Und the doctor he says I shall go now on the hospital. Und any way," she added sadly, "I ain't no good; I couldn't to see things. He says I shall lay in the hospital three weeks, may be—that is twenty-one days—und for Morris it is two dollars und ten cents. I got the money." And she fumbled for her purse in various hiding-places about her ample person.
